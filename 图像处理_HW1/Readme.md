# CV_Homework

  This is my homework for EE382-Visual localization &Perception

## HW1

### Requirement

Write a small program to implement a histogram specialization algorithm and test on 5 pairs of images with different exposure time.

### Environment Required

The program is implemented by Matlab. You should have Matlab 2015b+ to run the program.



### Tutorial for this program

To run the program, use matlab to open His_specialization.m and click run.

To adjust original image and target image, change the direction of img1 and img2 in this program.

```matlab
%img1 is the original image
img1 = imread('./image./3.jpg');
%img2 is the target image
img2 = imread('./image./4.jpg');
```



The test images are in **image** folder

The test results are in **result** folder
